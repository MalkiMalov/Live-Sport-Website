# Live-Sport-Website

This is my Live Sports website built with Flask.

# Get started:

- In the project root, create a venv
- Run on terminal source `venb/bin/activate` On Linux OR `venv\Scripts\activate.bat` on Windows
- Once activated, install Flask: `pip install flask`
- Get out from the venv: `deactivate`
- Run the following to set Flask env variables that are necessary
  - `set FLASK_APP=main.py`
  - `set FLASK_DEBUG=1`
  - Run the Project: `flask run`
